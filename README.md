# Hand Tracking and Volume Control

## Overview

This project demonstrates hand tracking using a webcam to control the system volume based on hand gestures. The hand tracking is achieved with MediaPipe, and volume control is managed via the `pycaw` library.

## Files

### 1. `trackingmodule.py`

This module implements hand detection and landmark extraction using the MediaPipe library.

#### Dependencies

- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `mediapipe`
- `time`

#### Class

**`handDetector`**: A class for detecting and tracking hand landmarks.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(self, mode=False, maxHands=2, detectionCon=0.5, modelComplexity=1, trackCon=0.5)`: Initializes the hand detection model with specified parameters.
  - `findHands(self, img, draw=True)`: Processes an image to detect hands and optionally draws landmarks on the image.
  - `findPosition(self, img, handNo=0, draw=True)`: Extracts the positions of hand landmarks and returns them as a list.

#### Usage

1. Run the script to start hand tracking and display video with detected hand landmarks.
    ```bash
    python trackingmodule.py
    ```

2. Press 'q' to exit the video window.

### 2. `volumecontrol.py`

This script uses hand tracking to control the system volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.

#### Dependencies

- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `numpy`
- `handtrackingmodule` (custom module)
- `math`
- `pycaw` (Python Core Audio Windows)

#### Functionality

- **Webcam Setup**: Initializes the webcam and sets resolution.
- **Hand Detection**: Uses `handDetector` from `trackingmodule.py` to track hand landmarks.
- **Volume Control**: Maps the distance between the thumb and index finger to system volume levels using the `pycaw` library.

#### How to Run

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy pycaw
    ```

2. Run the script to start hand tracking and control the volume:
    ```bash
    python volumecontrol.py
    ```

3. Adjust the distance between your thumb and index finger to change the volume. The volume will be updated in real-time based on the gesture.

4. Press 'd' to stop the video stream and exit.
